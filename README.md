My Website in React

Description
This is a web page project created using React, demonstrating the use of components to build an interactive and responsive user interface. The site is designed with users in mind, offering a clear and aesthetic way to showcase my skills and projects.

Key Features
Components: The application consists of various components, such as a header, "About Me" section, portfolio, and footer. Each component is responsible for a specific part of the page, allowing for easy management and expansion of the project.
Responsiveness: The site adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring an excellent user experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Interactivity: The use of state in React (e.g., useState hooks) to manage interactions, such as navigation or section expansion, enhances user experience with smooth transitions.

Technologies
React: The primary framework for building the user interface, allowing for easy component creation.
CSS: Used for styling the page to achieve a modern and attractive look.
Vite: A fast build tool that accelerates the development process.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
